As someone who used to be out in the field actually acquiring all the beautiful data that goes into our GIS, and who occasionally had to communicate lat\/long coordinates over VHF marine radios, I can see how having W3W would have made some aspects a little bit easier.  W3W isn't trying to change how everyone addresses a location all the time, but providing a human-centered way that works great in a limited set of circumstances.",
